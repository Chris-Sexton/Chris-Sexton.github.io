For my Sinatra project I created a ToDo app. My app allows a user to sign up and sign in to their account. Once a user signs up or signs in they can create, edit and delete lists and tasks. A user can create an individual task which they can assign to a given list. My app only allows a user to view their created lists and tasks.

This was a great project which gave me experience with a web framework. Sinatra helped layout the key fundamentals of a web framework and is a great starting point before jumping into rails. Sinatra is a nice frameowrk for building web applications such as my ToDo app.

For anyone who is new to programming it is nice to start with a framework like SInatra because it is not as intimidating as rails and is still very capable. Thanks to Sinatra I felt more comfortable learning rails because I had foundational knowledge of web frameworks. The best thing for me was to research articles and tutorials about Sinatra. I found that watching videos on YouTube and finding articles on Google became instrumental to my success.
