When I was hired for a digital marketing position at a local tech company here in Vermont I thought this is what I want to do for a career. I really enjoy working in digital marketing, but soon found out it wasn't what I was passionate about. Working closely with the Development team on new software I became more and more interested in pursuing a career in the web/software development field.

Before I was accepted into the Flatiron School's Learn-Verified Web Development program I had taken a couple of courses through Udemy.com learning HTML and CSS. Once I became more comfortable and knowledgeable with HTML and CSS I knew that a career in web development is what I wanted. Just having some HTML and CSS skills, I was able to build a very basic web site which enhanced my passion and curiosity with web development.

After learning about the Flatiron School and their online program I knew this would help me become a better developer and reach my goals. Even before leaving my digital marketing position I was looking for a career that offered more challenges and opportunities. I didn't just want to be someone who went into work every day looking at Google Adwords campaigns trying to see how I could improve account performance. I wanted to be capable of more. With everyday I am getting more confident and developing new skills which will help me as I continue my journey towards a career as a web developer.
