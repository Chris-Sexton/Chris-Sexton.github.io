Throughout the Learn Verified program I have had a good grasp on the material that was being presented. Once I started the Rails section of the program I realized how difficult programming can be to learn. Outside of the course material, I decided to conduct more research about rails. I watched rails tutorial videos on YouTube and RailsCasts which provided me with examples of how a more seasoned programmer goes about developing a ruby on rails web app. I also read many articles from different sources such as rubyonrails.org.

I also decided to take my learning a step further and purchased Michael's Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial book. This book provides a great deal of information while taking you step by step through a new rails project. I found that the best way to learn something like programming is to learn by examples. The more video tutorials that I watched the better my understanding was of ruby on rails. 

My rails project is a e-cookbook. My web app allows a user to sign up with a role of user (can edit or delete their comments), moderator (can edit and delete all comments) or admin (can edit or delete all comments, recipes and ingredients). I used the gem pundit to create user roles. My app also allows users to sign in with their GitHub account which is where I used the devise gem. Users can view ingredients and recipes that have been created by all users. At the top of the recipes page there is a section which displays the current user's created recipes with all created recipes listed just below that.

Since finishing my project I feel more comfortable with rails, but know there is still a lot more that I can accomplish. This section of the Learn Verified program has been a great learning experince and has helped me develop new skills, but has also pushed me to new programming heights.
