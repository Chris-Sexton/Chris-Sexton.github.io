<p>My name is Chris Sexton and I am from Colchester, VT. I graduated from Champlain College in Burlington, VT in May 2013 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business. I worked for a local tech company in digital marketing for 2 years before beginning my journey towards being a web developer. I started the Flatiron School's Learn-Verified Web Development program in January 2016 and have learned a lot about web development since being accepted into this program.</p>
